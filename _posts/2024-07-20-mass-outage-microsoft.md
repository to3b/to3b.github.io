title:  Y2K came 24 years too late - Mass outage of Windows computers.

## A little bit of background



## What actually happened

A Cyber Security company called CrowdStrike who equips potentially billion of computers with antivirus software pushed an update to most if not all online Windows computers at version 7.11 or above (unsure what the version means - maybe Windows 7 to 11+?) during the hours of Friday, July 19, 2024 04:09 UTC and Friday, July 19, 2024 05:27 UTC, and the update attempted to improve their current program but instead there was a bug in the code that was pushed that ended up giving every single computer a [logic error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_error) that was so bad it ended up with a BSoD (Blue Screen of Death)
