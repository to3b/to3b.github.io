title:  Hello World! -- Introduction and a little about me
---

Hey! My name is Toby and I will be using this blog to write about anything to do with Information Technology (IT) and Cyber Security. A breakdown of current news, any new skill or information that I have learn't recently through my research.

## My background -

I am very quite new to the Cyber Security field, although I have been observing from afar for quite awhile now using platforms such as YouTube, my favourite YouTubers around the Cyber Security niche are [@Seytonic](https://www.youtube.com/@Seytonic), [@_JohnHammond](https://www.youtube.com/@_JohnHammond), [@Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship), [@pcsecuritychannel](https://www.youtube.com/@pcsecuritychannel). I also watch way too many documentary YouTube channels that focus more on Cyber Crime, but most notably is: [@DisruptReality](https://www.youtube.com/@DisruptReality). 
I also have gathered prior knowledge such as advanced computer skills and how to use programs to learn about IT related concepts and I hope this will help me be able to research and demonstrate my knowledge effectively.

## My goal with this blog -

In the next year or two I am hoping to get into a University type education for: first an Information Technology course and then a Cyber Security course after that. I am wanting to give this blog in as part of my application and to show my interest in learning and ability to learn about these 2 fields.

I am hoping that I will be able to write something into this blog atleast once every 2 weeks to share what I have been learning recently, Like recently I have been going through the [CompTIA N10-008 Network+ Training Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnlCJiCrOYuRYb6cne864a7G) by [Professor Messer](https://www.youtube.com/@professormesser) which is 93 videos about the different aspects of running an online network. It is completely free and it attempts to help the viewer get the [Network+ (Plus) Certification](https://www.comptia.org/faq/network/what-is-comptia-network-certification), at this moment this website is having a major outage but looking at other sources it looks like you can learn skills such as Networking Concepts, Network Implementations, Network Operations, Network Security, Network Troubleshooting (list taken from [here](https://partners.comptia.org/certifications/network) just from attempting this exam.

I hope throughout this blog I will be able to inform you about about anything to do with Information Technology and Cyber Security from my perspectives as a learning researcher.

Thank you,
Toby.
